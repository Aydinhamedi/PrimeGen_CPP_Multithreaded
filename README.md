# PrimeGen_CPP_Multithreaded
A multi-threaded prime number generator that efficiently finds and logs prime numbers to a file. Utilizes modern C++ features like atomic variables, mutexes, and condition variables for thread synchronization. The program dynamically adjusts the number of threads based on the hardware concurrency or a custom number, ensuring optimal performance.
